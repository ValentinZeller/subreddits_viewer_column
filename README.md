Subreddits Viewer Column is a website to view multiple subreddits as columns.
Write in the text area the subreddits you want to view, each separated by a ',' and then click on the "Manage the list" button to update.
Click on a post to access its content and comments.
At the top of the post view, there is a button to close the post and a link to the post in reddit.

**You can't use this website as a complete alternative to reddit since you can't log, vote or post.

Known issues :
- Lack of informations about posts/authors/comments
- UI/UX need adjustments
